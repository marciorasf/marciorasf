### Hello World, MÃ¡rcio here ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I'm a software developer currently working at [Letalk](https://www.letalk.com.br/).

I have a solid Node.js + React.js stack knowledge combined to SQL or NoSQL databases. I also can write Python 3 applications and some C programs.

At the moment, I'm focused in improving my knowledges in the fundamentals of software engineering, such as: Data Structures, Algorithms, SOLID, Design Patterns and Refactoring. Sometimes I study about DevOps and Architectures too.
