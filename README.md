### Hi there, MÃ¡rcio here ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I'm an Electrical Engineering undegraduate student at UFMG. Not so long ago I decided that I wanted to be a software developer, so that's why my repositories, among other things, are a mess.

Also I'm a dev intern on [PicSize](https://picsize.com.br/).

ðŸ”­ Besides my internship and undergrad disciplines, I'm working on a [Flashcards](https://marciorasf-flashcards.herokuapp.com/) web app. The basics services are working, but I'm with no time to finish it yet.

ðŸŒ± I'm also learning Python and Data Science fundamentals due to undergrad disciplines.
