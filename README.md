### Hi there, MÃ¡rcio here ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I'm a software engineer currently working at [Bume](https://bume.com/).

I have a solid Node.js + React.js stack knowledge combined to SQL or NoSQL databases. I also can also work with python and C.

At the moment I'm focused in learning software engineering concepts, including: architecture, cloud computing, clean code, design patterns and deep OOP concepts.
